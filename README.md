# Data Analysis Workshop with Azure Databricks
##### Denmark Technical University, Copenhagen - March 2022
## Overview

This workshop content helps one get started on data engineering and data science by showing hands-on - how to use a sample dataset 
to spot patterns and answer important business questions

In this workshop, we will use a dataset about "E-Commerce Data" from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/benroshan/ecommerce-data), perform data analysis on it using Python 
using Databricks Platform on Azure.


[Databricks](https://databricks.com/) is a comprehensive data analytics platform optimized for developing data intensive applications: 
Data Science & Engineering, and Machine Learning.  It supports Python, Scala, R and SQL

- In the workspace menu, create a sub-folder under `/Shared/` folder with naming convention `<firstname_lastname>`. 
- This is where each of us creates the code we write during the workshop
- Write simple code (Python, SQL etc) to play with the data, using the compute resources to execute data related processing
- For this exercise,  we have some clusters already configured  - 
``` dtu_group_1, dtu_group_2```
